## Project Summary

**Problem Space** Connecting across distances is the domain that we will be focusing on, with a theme of cultural awareness. The meaning of connecting across distances can mean many things have and many different contexts. One can perceive it as connecting people over physical distances, another can perceive it as bridging different generations and age groups. We talk about connecting across distances here in the sense that people who come from a certain cultural background may feel that they have an emotional distance between them and another person who comes from a different cultural background, despite having little or no physical distance between them.

As non-dominant cultural groups have to go through a lot during the process of acculturation as they are required to master an unfamiliar language and the accepted social behaviour of the dominant cultural groups among other things it is expected that some individuals will suffer from acculturative stress. According to a study by Julie F. Smart David W. Smart, acculturative stress can have a number of negative impacts towards individuals in non dominant cultural groups who are undergoing acculturation and adaptation. Physical health can be affected caused by stressful life events and disrupted social ties which can happen as an individual enters a new dominant culture, which can lead to greater risks for physical illness. Decision making can also be affected as high levels of stress and anxiety can narrow the range of options they see are possible or viable which makes options that might have well have been reasonably possible seem far out of reach. Other implications feelings of marginality and alienation, which only leads to more negative implications In the end it is all up to the individuals and groups that are undergoing the process of acculturation and all of it depends of the characteristics of everyone at play such as age, gender, country of origin as many other things.

**Our Solution** The solution that we developed was the iCulture Mobile Application. The team designed an App so that connect people that want to spread information about their culture with those who want to learn. The information contained within the application itself will be sourced and edited by users of the application. In saying so we do not want open editing of content, as we want information to remain factual and accurate. Ideally all text content, images and video will be crowd sourced with users sending resources to the design team and then getting uploaded after being deemed appropriate.

## How To Use iCulture

### Instructions of Use:

For this project we decided to focus on Chinese New Year as this is simply a proof of concept and not a complete application.
Go to this link [bit.ly/iCulture2018](bit.ly/iCulture2018) , and choose to try the prototype

**To find content follow these steps:**

1) When the browser loads you will be presented with the Start-Up Screen. Press "Continue".
2) You will be directed to the Home Screen. Press the "Chinese New Year" even under the category of "Popular Events" or "Events Near You"
3) You will be directed to the "Chinese New Year" event page. Press "Next".
4) You are now free to explore this section about Chinese New Year.

**Key points about each section:**

* **Overview**: Simple overview of the event. "Events Near You" button will bring up a map with events relating to Chinese New Year that are happening in your local area.
* **Videos**: 360 degree videos. Best seen using Google Cardboard or VR Headset.
* **Food**: Brief summary of food eaten during the time of Chinese New Year. Click on a dish to receive more information.
* **Attractions**: Brief summary of attractions and events that happen during Chinese New Year. Click on an attraction to receive more information.

### Instructions of Installing Locally

**To install the project locally on your computer, follow these steps**
1) * [Clone with HTTPS] Open terminal and clone this repository wherever you want on your computer
`git clone https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Bridgimon.git`
   * [Clone with SSH] Use an SSH key and passphrase from account. `git@github.com:deco3500-2018/Bridgimon.git`
   
2) Install vue by using npm `npm install vue`
3) In the iCulture Directory, run `npm run dev` to run it in your localhost
4) To deploy the project on github, run  `npm run build` and push the latest commit to your repository




## Design Process

The design process of iCulture consisted of many phases throughout the course of the DECO3500. The first of these phases was Idea generation & brain-storming, which the results can be found in the [Proposal](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Bridgimon/wiki/Proposal) section of our WIKI page. After we were set on our theme dan domain space, we started to conduct further research revolving our domain and our project. The results of which can be found in the [Cultural Events](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Bridgimon/wiki/(Interview-Transcripts)-Researching-Cultural-Events) and [Video/VR](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Bridgimon/wiki/(Interview-Transcript)-Video---360--VR) sections of our WIKI page. The team also conducted tests on the wireframes that were developed which can be found in the [Wireframe Testing](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Bridgimon/wiki/(Interview-Transcript)-Wireframe-Testing)

With the data that was gathered and the insights that were collected, the team was able to started developing iCulture. The process of development consisted on three interations which is discussed in detail in the [Iterations](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Bridgimon/wiki/Iterations) section of our WIKI page.

The team also held weekly meetings, be it in the in-class workshops, outside-class meetings, our peer programming sessions. All of the results and insights that were gathered from these weekly meetings were documented in the [Weekly Meetings](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Bridgimon/wiki/Ongoing-Documentation) section of our WIKI page.


## Development Process

The team chose to use Vue.js to develop the proof of concept prototype. Vue.js is a very popular front-end Javascript framework allows us to create modern web applications. Since the team's programmers were already familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and one of them already being familiar with Vue.js, we thought that this would be the perfect tool to use to develop the iCulture proof of concept.

Once the high-fidelity mock-up of the design was created, the team's programmers started the development process. As this concept needed a lot of content revolving Chinese New Year, the team had to research a lot of content that we wanted to include in the app. The results of this research can be found in the [Chinese New Year Content](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Bridgimon/wiki/Proof-of-Concept-Content) section of our WIKI page.

## Promotional Material
For the end of semester showcase, the team prepared several forms of promotional material that aim to promote the iCulture app and the ideas behind it. These promotional materials included:

* **[Poster](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Bridgimon/wiki/Poster)**
* **[Brochure](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Bridgimon/wiki/Brochure)**
* **[Promotional Website](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Bridgimon/wiki/Promotional-Website)**
