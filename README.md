## Project Summary

**Problem Space** Connecting across distances is the domain that we will be focusing on, with a theme of cultural awareness. The meaning of connecting across distances can mean many things have and many different contexts. One can perceive it as connecting people over physical distances, another can perceive it as bridging different generations and age groups. We talk about connecting across distances here in the sense that people who come from a certain cultural background may feel that they have an emotional distance between them and another person who comes from a different cultural background, despite having little or no physical distance between them.

As non-dominant cultural groups have to go through a lot during the process of acculturation as they are required to master an unfamiliar language and the accepted social behaviour of the dominant cultural groups among other things it is expected that some individuals will suffer from acculturative stress. According to a study by Julie F. Smart David W. Smart, acculturative stress can have a number of negative impacts towards individuals in non dominant cultural groups who are undergoing acculturation and adaptation. Physical health can be affected caused by stressful life events and disrupted social ties which can happen as an individual enters a new dominant culture, which can lead to greater risks for physical illness. Decision making can also be affected as high levels of stress and anxiety can narrow the range of options they see are possible or viable which makes options that might have well have been reasonably possible seem far out of reach. Other implications feelings of marginality and alienation, which only leads to more negative implications In the end it is all up to the individuals and groups that are undergoing the process of acculturation and all of it depends of the characteristics of everyone at play such as age, gender, country of origin as many other things.

**Our Solution** The solution that we developed was the iCulture Mobile Application. The team designed an App so that connect people that want to spread information about their culture with those who want to learn. The information contained within the application itself will be sourced and edited by users of the application. In saying so we do not want open editing of content, as we want information to remain factual and accurate. Ideally all text content, images and video will be crowd sourced with users sending resources to the design team and then getting uploaded after being deemed appropriate.

## How To Use iCulture

### Instructions of Use:
For this project we decided to focus on Chinese New Year as this is simply a proof of concept and not a complete application.

**To find content follow these steps:**

1) When the browser loads you will be presented with the Start-Up Screen. Press "Continue".
2) You will be directed to the Home Screen. Press the "Chinese New Year" even under the category of "Popular Events" or "Events Near You"
3) You will be directed to the "Chinese New Year" event page. Press "Next".
4) You are now free to explore this section about Chinese New Year.

**Key points about each section:**

* **Overview**: Simple overview of the event. "Events Near You" button will bring up a map with events relating to Chinese New Year that are happening in your local area.
